# Image-Recognition
This project explores building and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It demonstrates the process of:

Loading and preprocessing image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a Cats vs. Dogs dataset).
Building and training CNN models from scratch.
Utilizing data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
Implementing transfer learning using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for the Cats vs. Dogs classification.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.
Saving and loading trained models.
Making predictions on new images.
This repository serves as a practical example of applying deep learning techniques to image recognition problems.
